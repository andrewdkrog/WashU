    "\n",
    "The maximum temperature for August 9, 2018 had a clear parabolic relationship with the latitude of the city, peaking somewhere near 25 degrees North. The reason the peak is in the northern hemisphere is because it is summer time there. I would expect the peak 6 months from now in February would be somewhere similar in terms of latitude but in the southern hemisphere (~25 degrees South, or -25 on the chart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloudiness clustered at round numbers with 0% and 90% appearing to be the most common values. There does not seem to be any obvious relationship between latitude and cloudiness among the cities randomly selected for this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cities had average wind speeds under 5 mph, although there was a considerable amount of variability. The highest wind speed for a city was close to 35 mph. Similar to cloudiness, there does not appear to be an easily observable relationship with wind speed and latitude for this day in August.\n",
