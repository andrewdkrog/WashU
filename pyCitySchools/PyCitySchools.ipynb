    "* For a \"hopefully not interpreted as causal by a politician\" observation, schools that had smaller budgets per student tended to have higher passing rates. Schools with budgets less than `$`615 per student had overall passing rates nearly 20% higher than schools with budgets greater than `$`615. Maybe teachers at the schools with small budgets altered their students tests, but overcorrected by a suspiciously large amount. Maybe all the smart kids go to those schools. Maybe whoever generated this data is a libertarian who hates government spending. I'm not sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While there was quite a bit of variation in passing rates for reading and math between schools, there was very little variation in passing rates between grades within each school. This could be due to some combination of schools generally drawing students with similar educational backgrounds and socioeconomic status for each grade and/or have a more or less uniform quality to the teaching at each grade level. Or maybe the data was generated using the same distribution for each school.\n",
